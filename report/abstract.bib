	Finding the minimum number of mutations necessary for one genome to transform into another is a major problem in molecular biology. If genomes are represented as numeric permutations, this problem can be reduced to sorting such permutations using certain genome rearrangements operations, where, in this work, reversals operations are the main focus. We present two different techniques using reinforcement learning to address that. Our results show that this approach is competitive for permutations of size $n < 11$. However, as the permutations grow, converging gets trickier.
